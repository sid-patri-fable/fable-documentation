## Tracking and Analyzing Demos: An overview

Having your team create and share multiple customized demos will be meaningless if you can’t track everything possible and analyze them. That is where Fable’s full-suite analytics helps you. We capture all interactions automatically to ensure you have the complete data.  

Our session level analytics as well as demo level analytics help you stay on top of every action performed by your users/ prospects/ customers. 

We’ll deep-dive into each of these and more in our demo insights section.
