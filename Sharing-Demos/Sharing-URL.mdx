## Sharing your demos via URL

In addition to embedding a Fable demo, you can also share them in the form of an URL. Once your interactive demo is published, all you have to do is share the URL with your viewers. This URL can be shared via email, chat, or even slack. Below is an example of how a demo URL would look like in Fable.
