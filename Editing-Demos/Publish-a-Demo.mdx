When you are ready to go live with a demo, you publish it so that all the sharable formats (iFrame embed, URL etc.) become active.

## How to Publish a Demo

The following interactive demo shows you how to publish a demo when you are ready to go live with the demo.

<div className="fable-embed-con">
<iframe 
   style={{border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", height: "60vh" }} 
   width="100%" 
   height="100%" 
   src="https://app.sharefable.com/p/demo/fable-documentation_pr-y3vzgzh3jqk68gic" 
   allowFullScreen
></iframe>
</div>

Note that, once a demo has been published, any edits you make will not reflect in the shared formats until you publish the changes. This provides you with a safety net in case the changes you make to an already shared demo has errors that you need to fix before the consumer even sees it.
