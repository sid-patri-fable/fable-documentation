The text annotation message comes with a plethora of customization options - the size of the message box, the position of the message box, the look and feel of the message box - everything can be customized as per your preference.

## Sizing and Positioning

The first set of annotation message customization are the size and position of the message. The interactive demo below will show how you can modify the size and position of the annotation message.

   style={{border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", height: "60vh" }} 
   width="100%" 
   height="100%"

### Sizing

Refers to the sizing of the annotation message box. The various options under sizing are:

- Small
- Medium
- Large
- Custom (where you can set a custom size for the box)

### Positioning

Refers to the position of the annotation message box relative to the element that is highlighted. The various options under positioning are:

- Auto (where the best possible position is determined by Fable)
- Custom (where you can set a fixed position for the annotation message box)

The size and position settings of the annotation applies only to the annotation on the screen which is being modified. You have the complete flexibility to select different sizes and positions for annotation messages across different screens of the demo.

Once the size and position have been set, the next set of customization options pertains to the color and shape which are clubbed under ‘Branding’. Head over to the next page to see how those customizations can be applied.
