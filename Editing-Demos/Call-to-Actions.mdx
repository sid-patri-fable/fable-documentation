The CTAs section lets you modify the buttons that are present in each annotation box throughout the demo.

## Managing Buttons

Buttons serve the important purpose of helping the consumer of a demo navigate around the demo. Fable by default has two buttons - Next and Back. However, you can add custom buttons to an annotation box, change the text of the ‘Next’ and ‘Back’ buttons, show or hide the buttons or even give a custom URL to be redirected to on the click of a button. The following interactive demo shows how you can customize buttons to suit your needs.
