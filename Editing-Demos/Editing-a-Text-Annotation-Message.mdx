A key part of an interactive demo is the guiding message that walks the consumer of the demo through the various steps.

## Editing a Text Annotation Message

The default annotation message within Fable is text. When a new demo is created, each step of the demo comes with an annotation message that is associated with the element of the web page/application that you interacted with at the time of capture. The very last step of the demo has a cover annotation.

When the demo is autostitched together, it includes a dummy text message that you can change at the time of editing the demo. Fableâ€™s text annotation message supports mark-down (i.e. you can format it anyway you like) as well as inclusion of images and gifs.

The interactive demo below shows how you can edit an annotation message:

<div className="fable-embed-con">
<iframe 
   style={{border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", height: "60vh" }} 
   width="100%" 
   height="100%" 
   src="https://app.sharefable.com/p/demo/fable-documentation_ed-offg4abetl2yr440" 
   allowFullScreen
></iframe>
</div>

As an alternative to text annotation message, you can also have a video annotation message where the information is relayed to the consumer of the demo through a video. The next page shows how you can add a video annotation.
