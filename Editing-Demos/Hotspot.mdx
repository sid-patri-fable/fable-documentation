Demos created using Fable are interactive by default - i.e. the consumer of a demo not only can navigate forward by clicking on ‘Next’ but also on the element of focus just the way they would have in the real web page/application. 

## Customizing Hotspot

In the Hotspot section, you can turn on/turn off the interactivity, hide the annotation box (in case you want your consumers to navigate around the demo just by clicking on the elements of the screen without any guidance), or add nested elements (which can add a further highlight on specific sub-elements within an highlighted element).

The following interactive demo shows how you can customize the above options within Fable.

<Test />
<Fable
layout="sidebyside"
demoRid="test-get2pic0iiosnvbo"
origin="http://localhost:3000"
contentWidthPercentage={51}
/>
<div className="fable-embed-con">
<iframe 
   style={{border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", height: "60vh" }} 
   width="100%"
