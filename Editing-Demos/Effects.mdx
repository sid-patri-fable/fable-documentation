A demo that is very aesthetically pleasing can be expected to have a higher engagement rate. Fable has some special effects that you can apply to the demo which will make them very eye catching.

## Applying Effects

Fable has two kinds of effects:

- **On screen effects**: On screen effects are effects that are applied to the elements on the screen. The different kinds of on screen effects are:
    - **Sincity**: Make the whole page black and white except the selected element.
    - **Clarity**: Make the whole page blurred out except the selected element.
    - **Material Design**: Apply Googleâ€™s material design focus style to the selected element.
    - **Cyberpunk**: Apply effects that have a feel of a post apocalyptic world.
    - **Custom**: You can apply custom effects by adding some custom CSS code.
- **On annotation effects**: On annotation effects are effects that are applied to the annotation box (e.g. all the annotation boxes in the demos in the help center have a wave effect applied to them). The different kinds of on annotation effects are:
    - **Wave**: Apply a wave effect on annotation.
    - **Beckham**: Apply a lighter color bend through the edge effect.
    - **Bleeding Edge**: Apply an effect of bleeding a complementary color through the edge.
    - **Glass Ceiling**: Apply a glass effect on the annotation.
    - **Custom**: You can apply custom effects by adding some custom CSS code.

The following interactive demo shows how you can apply these effects to a demo and make them irresistible.
