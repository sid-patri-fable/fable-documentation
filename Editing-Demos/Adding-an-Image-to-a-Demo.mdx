With Fable, you can add image files (e.g. screenshots, Figma image exports etc.) to your interactive demo and make it part of the flow.

## Adding an Image File

You can add an image to an existing demo in the following two ways:

### ‘Add a new screen to this demo’ option

- You can click on ‘Add a new screen to this demo’ button in the canvas.
- Select ‘Upload image’ option.
- The image file gets added to the demo with a cover annotation.
- You can change the annotation type and message and drag and drop it to the point in the demo flow where you want it to be.

The following interactive demo shows how you can add an image to an existing demo by using the ‘Add a new screen to this demo’ option.

<div className="fable-embed-con">
<iframe 
   style={{border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", height: "60vh" }} 
   width="100%" 
   height="100%" 
   src="https://app.sharefable.com/p/demo/fable-documentation_ad-47ha8wd4cegbdawc" 
   allowFullScreen
></iframe>
</div>

### ‘Create a new annotation’ option

- Go to the point where you want the image added.
- Click on ‘+’ of the preceding screen and create a new annotation using ‘By adding a new screen’.
- Select ‘Upload image’ option.
- The image file gets added to the demo with a cover annotation.
- You can modify the annotation, add additional annotation etc., to this image screen.

The following interactive demo shows how you can add an image to an existing demo by using the ‘Create a new annotation’ option.

<div className="fable-embed-con">
