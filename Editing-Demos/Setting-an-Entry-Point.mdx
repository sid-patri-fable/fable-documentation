An entry point tells Fable where to start the interactive demo when someone opens the iFrame embed/URL link of the demo. You cannot publish a demo without setting an entry point.

## Setting an Entry Point

The following interactive demo shows how you can set an entry point. The option to set an entry point is found under Advanced settings option of an annotation.
