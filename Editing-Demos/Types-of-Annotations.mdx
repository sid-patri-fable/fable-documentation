Annotation is the information that guides a person through the interactive demo. In Fable, there are three types of annotations and two formats for annotation messages - text and video.

- **Guide Annotation**: A guide annotation is an annotation message that is associated with an element of the screen (e.g. an annotation message that highlights a button and asks a person to click on the button to proceed).
- **Cover Annotation**: A cover annotation is an annotation message that is not associated with an element of the screen but the entire screen itself (e.g. a start/end message in an interactive demo which gives an overview/summary of the demo).
- **Multi Annotation**: A multi-annotation is an annotation message that creates a branch from the main demo. This can be used to create branched demos where you can give a person different paths to follow in the demo.

## Annotation Message Formats

There are two formats of annotation messages in Fable:

- **Text Annotation Message**: The annotation message is in the form of text.
- **Video Annotation Message**: The annotation message is in the form of video.
