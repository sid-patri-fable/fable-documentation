Preview lets you see the end to end demo flow the way a consumer of your demo would.

## How to Preview a Demo

The following interactive demo shows how you can preview a demo at any point in time (you can even do this right after capturing the demo or while in the middle of editing).

<iframe 
   style={{border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", height: "60vh" }} 
   width="100%" 
   height="100%" 
   src="https://app.sharefable.com/p/demo/fable-documentation_se-4nfw0f26ouiz8jul" 
   allowFullScreen
></iframe>

Previewing lets you see how the demo is shaping up and make any required changes before you take it live.
