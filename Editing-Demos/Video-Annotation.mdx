Fable gives you the option of guiding the consumers of your demo either with text annotation messages or video annotation messages.

## Adding a Video Annotation

You can replace the text annotation message on a captured screen with a video annotation. The following interactive demo shows how you can easily add a video annotation message.

<iframe 
   style={{border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", height: "60vh" }} 
   width="100%" 
   height="100%" 
   src="https://app.sharefable.com/p/demo/fable-documentation_vi-9eiei9n17wswpmgt" 
   allowFullScreen
></iframe>

With editing of annotation messages out of the way, the next page takes a look at how you can customize the sizing and positioning of the annotation message box.
