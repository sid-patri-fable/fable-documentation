## Fable integrations

With our integrations, you can send demo events to your CRM, Marketing Automation tools, and many more. 

Setting up your integration to receive data in your preferred tool would be the next step after creating a Fable demo and beginning to view events.

As of today, Fable integrates with SalesForce and HubSpot. Further, the following integrations are going live soon:

- Zapier
- WebHooks
- Marketo
- Pardot
- Google Analytics
- Segment

If you have any questions regarding these integrations or if you wish to have an integration custom built for you, do send us an email to support@sharefable.com.
