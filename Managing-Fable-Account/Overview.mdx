## Managing Fable account: An overview

In this section, weâ€™ll show you how to manage your demos, users, and your billing with Fable. 

**Managing your demos**: Once you have created your interactive demos with Fable, you can share them, rename them or duplicate them as and when you need. 

**Managing your users**: You can add new users or remove existing users from your organization account with Fable. This can be done from the User Management section of your Fable dashboard. 

**Managing your billing**: You can upgrade or downgrade your plan from the Billing section of your Fable dashboard. On completion of payments, invoices will be sent your registered email ID instantly.
