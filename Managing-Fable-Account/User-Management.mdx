## User Management

This section explains how to manage multiple users in your organization account of Fable

How do I add a new user to my Fable account? 

Fable has made it super easy for your colleagues and team members to join your organization account. When you create an account with Fable using your official email ID, we automatically create an organization account in the name of your company. Going forward, if any team member has to join the same account, all they have to do is sign up to Fable with their official email ID. 

Alternatively, if you wish to invite an user - you can do so from the User Management section of your Fable dashboard. Just click on “Invite a user” and type each team member’s email ID. An invitation will be sent to let them become a part of your organization account in Fable.

How do I deactivate a user from my Fable account? 

You can do so from the User Management section of your Fable dashboard. This section lists all the users who currently have access to your account. All you have to do it click on “Deactivate user” to remove a user from your account.
