## Billing

This section will help you manage your billing with Fable & give you an overview of our different plans. 

You can upgrade/ downgrade your plan from the “Billing section” in your Fable dashboard. Our pricing is super simple. We charge $100 per user per month and have special discounts for teams with multiple users. 

Once you finalize the plan you intend to purchase, click on “Make payment” and complete the purchase. Here’s a short interactive demo showing you the same.
